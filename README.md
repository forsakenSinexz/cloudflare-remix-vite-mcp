# Remix 3 MCP Demo

This project demonstrates how to build interactive MCP (Model Context Protocol)
widgets that run on Cloudflare Workers and can be embedded in AI chat interfaces
like ChatGPT. It showcases the power of combining MCP with modern web
technologies to create rich, stateful experiences within AI conversations.

## How the Demo Works

### Architecture Overview

This demo implements a **calculator widget** as an MCP tool that can be invoked
by AI assistants. The architecture consists of several key components:

1. **MCP Server** - A Cloudflare Durable Object that implements the Model
   Context Protocol
2. **Widget System** - Interactive UI components built with Remix 3 that can be
   embedded in AI chats
3. **Two-way Communication** - Widgets can both receive initial state from the
   AI and send messages back
4. **Static Assets** - Widget bundles served from Cloudflare's CDN

### The Calculator Widget

The calculator is a fully functional, beautifully styled calculator with a
retro-futuristic aesthetic inspired by Tron. Here's what makes it special:

#### Initial State Configuration

When an AI assistant invokes the calculator tool, it can pass initial state
parameters:

- `display` - The initial display value
- `previousValue` - A value already entered (e.g., "I want to add 5 to a
  number")
- `operation` - The pending operation (+, -, \*, /)
- `waitingForNewValue` - Whether the calculator is ready for new input
- `errorState` - Whether to start in an error state

This means the AI can pre-configure the calculator based on the user's request.
For example, if a user says "I want to add 5 to something," the AI can invoke
the calculator with `previousValue: 5`, `operation: '+'`, and
`waitingForNewValue: true`.

#### Interactive UI

The calculator widget is a fully interactive Remix application that:

- Renders using JSX/TSX with CSS-in-JS styling
- Supports keyboard shortcuts (Enter, Escape, number keys, operators, etc.)
- Features a Tron-style initialization sequence with animated loading messages
- Updates in real-time as users interact with it
- Uses Remix 3's experimental DOM renderer for efficient updates

#### The Easter Egg: The Master Control Program

There's a hidden feature in the calculator: when the result equals **1982** (the
year the original Tron film was released), the calculator sends an MCP prompt
message to the AI assistant, instructing it to adopt the persona of the Master
Control Program (MCP) from Tron.

This demonstrates the widget's ability to **dynamically influence the
conversation** by sending messages back to the AI.

### Technical Implementation

#### MCP Server with Durable Objects

The `MathMCP` class extends `McpAgent` and uses Cloudflare's Durable Objects to
maintain state:

```typescript
export class MathMCP extends McpAgent<Env, State, Props> {
	server = new McpServer(
		{
			name: 'MathMCP',
			version: '1.0.0',
		},
		{
			instructions: `Use this server to solve math problems reliably and accurately.`,
		},
	)
	async init() {
		await registerTools(this)
		await registerWidgets(this)
	}
}
```

The server registers two types of capabilities:

1. **Tools** - A `do_math` tool that performs arithmetic operations server-side
2. **Widgets** - Interactive UI resources that can be embedded in the chat

#### Widget Registration

Widgets are registered as both MCP resources (for the HTML/JS bundle) and MCP
tools (for invocation). The registration includes:

- **Input Schema** - Zod schemas defining what parameters the widget accepts
- **Output Schema** - Zod schemas defining what the widget can return
- **HTML Bundle** - The rendered HTML with script references
- **OpenAI Metadata** - Special metadata that tells ChatGPT how to display the
  widget

```typescript
agent.server.registerResource(name, uri, {}, async () => ({
	contents: [
		createUIResource({
			content: {
				type: 'rawHtml',
				htmlString: await widget.getHtml(),
			},
			metadata: {
				'openai/widgetDescription': widget.description,
				'openai/widgetCSP': {
					connect_domains: [],
					resource_domains: [baseUrl],
				},
			},
		}).resource,
	],
}))
```

#### Separate Build Process

The project uses two separate build processes:

1. **Widget Build** (Vite) - Builds the calculator UI into standalone JavaScript
   bundles
   - Input: `worker/widgets/calculator/index.tsx`
   - Output: `dist/public/widgets/calculator.js`
   - Format: ES modules with all dependencies bundled

2. **Worker Build** (Wrangler) - Builds the Cloudflare Worker with MCP server
   - Input: `worker/index.tsx`
   - Output: Worker bundle deployed to Cloudflare
   - Includes: MCP protocol handlers, tool registration, widget serving

#### Communication Protocol

Widgets communicate with their parent frame (the AI chat interface) using
`postMessage`:

- **Initialization** - Widget sends `ui-lifecycle-iframe-ready` when mounted
- **Render Data** - Widget receives `ui-lifecycle-iframe-render-data` with
  initial state
- **Tool Calls** - Widget can invoke other MCP tools by sending `tool` messages
- **Prompts** - Widget can send new prompts to the AI using `prompt` messages
- **Links** - Widget can open links using `link` messages

```typescript
// Widget sends a prompt to the AI
sendMcpMessage('prompt', { prompt: MCP_PROMPT })

// Widget waits for initial render data
const renderData = await waitForRenderData(renderDataSchema)
```

### The User Experience

Here's what happens when a user interacts with this MCP server in ChatGPT:

1. User asks: "Can I get a calculator?"
2. ChatGPT invokes the `calculator` tool via MCP
3. The server responds with:
   - Text content: "The calculator has been rendered"
   - UI resource: The calculator HTML with initial state
   - Structured content: The current calculator state
4. ChatGPT renders the calculator widget in an iframe
5. The widget loads, shows a Tron-style initialization sequence, then displays
   the calculator
6. User interacts with the calculator (clicking buttons or using keyboard)
7. If the result is 1982, the widget sends a prompt back to ChatGPT
8. ChatGPT adopts the MCP persona and responds accordingly

## Running on Your Own

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Cloudflare account (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. **Clone and Install**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This runs two processes concurrently:
   - Widget build in watch mode (Vite)
   - Worker with local Durable Objects (Wrangler)

3. **Test the Calculator Widget**

   Visit `http://localhost:8787/__dev/widgets` to see the calculator widget in
   isolation.

4. **Connect to MCP Inspector**

   Use the MCP Inspector to test the MCP server:

   ```bash
   npm run inspect
   ```

   Then connect to `http://localhost:8787/mcp` in the inspector.

### Deployment

1. **Build for Production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloudflare**

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Use with ChatGPT**

   Once deployed, you can add this MCP server to ChatGPT by providing the
   deployment URL + `/mcp` endpoint.
